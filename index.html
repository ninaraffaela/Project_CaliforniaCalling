            <h2>Stuck in the middle.</h2>

            <p>Surrounded by smoke and inspired by the communities’ resilience, our design team reimagined the
                California Grizzly and used it to create custom tees, pins and posters.</p>

            <p>Our t-shirts (kids and adult sizes), pins, and posters will be available for purchase at our exclusive
                pop-up shop during our SF Design Week Studio Crawl this Friday, June 21. You can choose what amount to
                donate. All proceeds will go to the American Red Cross to help the communities that are still displaced.

                <p>This design is all about the resilience of California to overcome difficult situations and come out
                    stronger than before. It’s a flip of the UNC Tarheel mascot with added elements like the California
                    poppy.</p>
